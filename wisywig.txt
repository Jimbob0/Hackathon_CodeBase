########## WISYWIG ##########
I spent some time looking around for a simple enough wisywig that didn't seem to complicated, but included the options that we would need. (most of the other ones were either way overboard with their options, or way simple and kinda looked 2001ish...)
the source, API and docs for this are at:
http://summernote.org/getting-started/#simple-example
below I've included the basics on how to implement it, but any other options like syling for it will be at that website.
#############################

// include these at the top of the HTML, just like you would with JQuery or Bootstrap CDNs

<!-- include libraries(jQuery, bootstrap) -->
<link href="http://netdna.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.5/css/bootstrap.css" rel="stylesheet">
<script src="http://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.1.4/jquery.js"></script> 
<script src="http://netdna.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.5/js/bootstrap.js"></script> 

<!-- include summernote css/js-->
<link href="http://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/summernote/0.8.1/summernote.css" rel="stylesheet">
<script src="http://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/summernote/0.8.1/summernote.js"></script>

// include a div with any small text like "New post", or something like that, make something up...
<div id="summernote">Hello Summernote</div>

// add this in a script tag !!below the div that was created!! so that it will be created after the document is loaded
$(document).ready(function() {
  $('#summernote').summernote(*****);
  });

// where the stars are in the previous code snipped will be where you include height and focus options, play around with those so that it looks good 

// any other content will go below the closing script tag
